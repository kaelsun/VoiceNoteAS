# VoiceNoteAS
VoiceNote code imported to android studio

At first, I coded in the help of eclipse. Then I realized that Android Studio is being stronger and stronger, so...

This project is situated between a demo and a product, it can be of some help if you came up with an idea, and with your android telephone in your hand.

And of course, in this project I used some kind of "self thinking" good practice, kind of experiment for future projects.
